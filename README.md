# Data Mining
## Introduction
### What is data mining
- Data mining aims to discover **patterns** and **rules** from large amount of data.
- Helps with the **prediction** of future _events_ and **classification** of past ones.
- Also known as **KDD**: _Knowledge Discovery in Database_.


### Data mining Process
       Raw Data ← ──────────────────────────────────────── Knowledge
          |                                                    ↑
          ↓                                                    |
    Data Warehouse → Target Data → Transformed Data → Patterns and Rules

### Origin of data
- The data usually comes from measurements of the real world
- Using data from the past, you can predict the future

### Problems with data
- **Errors** ─ data might not be not accurate, or missing/
- **Quantity** ─ data might no be enough to find accurate patterns.
- **Quality** ─ data might not contain the information you need.
- **Cost** ─ data might be too expensive to obtain.

### Data mining techniques
- K-nearest neighbour
- K-means clustering
- Decision trees
- Neural networks
- Market basket analysis
- Logistic regression
- ARIMA ─ _Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average_

### Glossary
- **Data** ─ _Data_ are measurements of _values_ associated with _variables_.
- **Data Model** ─ A representation of some aspects of the _data_, usually performing a _task_.
- **Inference** ─ Querying a _model_ to obtain a prediction from some input _data_.
- **Learning** ─ _Learning_ is the process of using _data_ to build a _model_ capable of performing a _task_.
- **Nominal** ─ Nominal _Variables_ describe a quality, such as gender or colour. They are also known as _categorical labels_.
- **Numeric** ─ _Variables_ can be numeric, accepting numbers as _values_.
- **Task** ─ What the end system is supposed to do.
- **Variable** ─ A property that can be measured and varies.
- **Value** ─ A _variable_ can be assigned to a certain set of _values_.
